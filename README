This is a fantasy computer/console emulator based around the M68000 cpu.
It is highly unfinished. The (planned) specs are on `SPECS`.
The vasm(m68k) assembler is required.

To build a libretro shared executable (on Linux and possibly other Unix-likes):

	make

A dumb typing "game" can be built and run with:

	make devcart.rom
	retroarch -L sandman-libretro.so devcart.rom

"Retroarch" may be replaced with any libretro frontend.
